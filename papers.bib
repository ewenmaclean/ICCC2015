@Comment{PAPERS.BIB -   
Welcome to the DReaM group bibliography file. In order to
simplify everyone's paper citation problem you are urged to
insert in this file entries for every paper you cite that might
be useful to someone in the group at some future time.  In
addition, everyone in the group is responsible for ensuring that
they insert entries for their own papers. When doing this please
use the following group conventions. 
 
Departmental Research Paper number NNN should be entered with the
key word rpNNN. Similarly, for working papers use wpNNN,
technical papers tpNNN, discussion papers dpNNN, etc. Blue book
notes are not usually entered, but if they must be then use
noteNNN. If the number of a paper is not known when it is
initially inserted then use some mnemonic and then update this as
soon as posible. Insert @comment(Was <old-keyword>) 
just above the entry to assist people to update their citations.  If a
research paper is subsequently published then a new entry should be
inserted with keyword pubNNN. For multiple publications, eg a
conference paper becomes a journal paper, use pubNNNb, pubNNNc, etc.

Entries are ordered alphabetically by first author and then by
date of publication. There are alphabetic markers, eg
@comment{Marker for AAAaaa}, to help you find the right place.}

  abstract =	 "We present various refutationally complete calculi
                  for first-order clauses with equality that allow for
                  arbitrary selection of negative atoms in
                  clauses. Refutation completeness is established via
                  the use of well-founded orderings on clauses for
                  defining a Herbrand model for a consistent set of
                  clauses. We also formulate an abstract notion of
                  redundancy and show that the deletion of redundant
                  clauses during the theorem proving process preserves
                  refutation completeness. It is often possible to
                  compute the closure of nontrivial sets of clauses
                  under application of non-redundant inferences. The
                  refutation of goals for such complete sets of
                  clauses is simpler than for arbitrary sets of
                  clauses, in particular one can restrict attention to
                  proofs that have support from the goals without
                  compromising refutation completeness. Additional
                  syntactic properties allow to restrict the search
                  space even further, as we demonstrate for so-called
                  quasi-Horn clauses. The results in this paper
                  contain as special cases or generalize many known
                  results about Knuth-Bendix-like completion
                  procedures (for equations, Horn clauses, and Horn
                  clauses over built-in Booleans), completion of
                  first-order clauses by clausal rewriting, and
                  inductive theorem proving for Horn clauses. "

  abstract =	 {Information is a central topic in computer science,
                  cognitive science, and philosophy. In spite of its
                  importance in the "information age," there is no
                  consensus on what information is, what makes it
                  possible, and what it means for one medium to carry
                  information about another. Drawing on ideas from
                  mathematics, computer science, and philosophy, this
                  book addresses the definition and place of
                  information in society. The authors, observing that
                  information flow is possible only within a connected
                  distribution system, provide a mathematically
                  rigorous, philosophically sound foundation for a
                  science of information. They illustrate their theory
                  by applying it to a wide range of phenomena, from
                  file transfer to DNA, from quantum mechanics to
                  speech act theory.},

  ABSTRACT =	 " We extend previous work on difference
                  identification and reduction as a technique for
                  automated reasoning. We generalize unification so
                  that terms are made equal not only by finding
                  substitutions for variables but also by hiding term
                  structure. This annotation of structural differences
                  serves to direct rippling, a kind of rewriting
                  designed to remove structural differences in a
                  controlled way. On the technical side, we give a
                  rule-based algorithm for difference unification, and
                  analyze its correctness, completeness, and
                  complexity. On the practical side, we present a
                  novel search strategy (called left-first search) for
                  applying these rules in an efficient way. Finally,
                  we show how this algorithm can be used in new ways
                  to direct rippling and how it can play an important
                  role in theorem proving and other kinds of automated
                  reasoning."

                  identify regularity in circuits, including those
                  that are parameterized or have parameterized
                  behavioral specifications. Our proofs are semantic
                  are semantic and do not require lemmas or induction

  ABSTRACT =	 "We show how labelled deductive systems can be
                  combined with a logical framework to provide a
                  natural deduction implementation of a large and
                  well-known class of propositional modal logics
                  (including $K$, $D$, $T$, $B$, $S4$, $S4.2$, $KD45$,
                  $S5$). Our approach is modular and based on a
                  separation between a base logic and a labelling
                  algebra, which interact through a fixed
                  interface. While the base logic stays fixed,
                  different modal logics are generated by plugging in
                  appropriate algebras. This leads to a hierarchical
                  structuring of modal logics with inheritance of
                  theorems. Moreover, it allows modular correctness
                  proofs, both with respect to soundness and
                  completeness for semantics, and faithfulness and
                  adequacy of the implementation. We also investigate
                  the tradeoffs in possible labelled presentations: We
                  show that a narrow interface between the base logic
                  and the labelling algebra supports modularity and
                  provides an attractive proof-theory (in comparision
                  to, e.g., semantic embedding) but limits the degree
                  to which we can make use of extensions to the
                  labelling algebra."

                  planning techniques to find proofs at a high-level,
                  especially where inductive proofs are required. HOL
                  is a theorem prover for a classical higher-order
                  logic and has been widely used in both academia and
                  industry for verification of hardware and
                  software. The interface sends HOL goals to Clam for
                  planning, and translates plans back into HOL tactics
                  that solve the initial goals."

  title =	 {Theory Exploration Versus Theorem Proving: Why
                  Automated Theorem Proving Has Little Impact on
                  Mathematics},
  author =	 {Bruno Buchberger},
  year =	 {2008},
  abstract =	 {Automated theorem proving is a well established
                  subject in computer science. The advances made in
                  the algorithmic techniques for automated theorem
                  proving are impressive, see the survey paper
                  [Loveland 1996]. Also, automated theorem proving has
                  found various important applications in computer
                  science. For example, Robinson’s resolution proving
                  method launched a whole new programming paradigm,
                  namely logic programming. Amazingly, although
                  proving is the essence of mathematics, the advances
                  of automated theorem proving did not have any
                  noticeable influence on the practice of mathematical
                  research and teaching so far. We do believe,
                  however, that automated theorem proving should,
                  could and will have an important impact on the
                  future of mathematics, more precisely on the way how
                  mathematics is &amp;quot;done&amp;quot;. For this to
                  happen we think that the basic paradigm must change
                  from automated theorem proving towards
                  computer−supported theory exploration. In fact, in
                  our view, the paradigm of theory exploration is not
                  only the natural paradigm for using automated or
                  computer−supported proving systems but also for
                  doing mathematics by paper and pencil. In this
                  paper, we will first clarify the paradigm of theory
                  exploration and then give a couple of examples that
                  should illustrate the paradigm. The examples are
                  carried out in the frame of the Theorema system, a
                  system designed to be a common frame for proving,
                  solving, and simplifying mathematical formulae, see

                  increasing prominence of lazy data
                  structures. Through the use of bisimulations and
                  proofs that observational equivalence is a
                  congruence in various domains it can be used to
                  proof the congruence of two processes. Several proof
                  tools have been developed to aid coinductive proofs
                  but all require user interaction. Crucially they
                  require the user to supply an appropriate relation
                  which the system can then prove to be a
                  bisimulation. A method is proposed which uses the
                  idea of proof plans to make a heuristic guess at a
                  suitable relation. If the proof fails for that
                  relation the reasons for failure are analysed using
                  a proof critic and a new relation is proposed to
                  allow the proof to go through."

                  similar elements of different specifications. He
                  effecitvely defines a second order matching scheme
                  that can use theories to provide additional
                  matchings. In his approach specifications are
                  aligned and then matched; type information is then
                  used to define sets of `abstract entities' for each
                  binding (analogy) of specification components that
                  introductes a type mismatch. These mappings
                  (bindings) are then used to transform an existing
                  concrete program schemea (the specification of which
                  is used above) into an abstract schemea. Now this
                  abstract scheme may be incorrect and so it pre and
                  post conditions may require strengthening to ensure
                  that when the abstract schemea is instantiated, it
                  results in a correct program. His presentation is
                  clear, but the approach relies on subtle selection
                  of mappings when the analogy is chosen and even more
                  heavily on the reasoning required to determine
                  (using the correctness proofs of the concrete

                  cognitive processes students implement when they
                  prove assertions in Calculus, specifically a
                  cognitive model that would help to recognize
                  creative processes of an abductive nature. To this
                  end, Peirce?s Theory of Abduction and Harel?s Theory
                  of Transformational Proof Scheme have been used. The
                  result has been the construction of the Abductive
                  System whose elements are {facts, conjectures,
                  statements, actions}; briefly, conjectures and facts
                  are ?act of reasoning? generated by phenomenic or
                  abductive actions, and expressed by ?act of speech?

  ABSTRACT =	 "The reasoning power of human-oriented plan-based
                  reasoning systems is primarily derived from their
                  domain-specific problem solving knowledge. Such
                  knowledge is, however, intrinsically incomplete. In
                  order to model the human ability of adapting
                  existing methods to new situations we present in
                  this work a declarative approach for representing
                  methods, which can be adapted by so-called
                  meta-methods. Since the computational success of
                  this approach relies on the existence of general and
                  strong meta-methods, we describe several
                  meta-methods of general interest in detail by
                  presenting the problem solving process of two
                  familiar classes of mathematical problems. These
                  examples should illustrate our philosophy of proof
                  planning as well: besides planning with a
                  pre-defined repertory of methods, the repertory of
                  methods evolves with experience in that new ones are
                  created by meta-methods that modify existing ones."

  abstract =	 " Mechanised reasoning systems and computer algebra
                  systems have different objectives. Their integration
                  is highly desirable, since formal proofs often
                  involve both of the two different tasks, proving and
                  calculating. Even more importantly, proof and
                  computation are often interwoven and not easily
                  separable. In this contribution we advocate an
                  integration of computer algebra into mechanised
                  reasoning systems at the proof plan level. This
                  approach allows to view the computer algebra
                  algorithms as {\em methods}, that is, declarative
                  representations of the problem solving knowledge
                  specific to a certain mathematical
                  domain. Automation can be achieved in many cases by
                  searching for a hierarchic {\em proof plan\/} at the
                  method-level using suitable domain-specific control
                  knowledge about the mathematical algorithms. In
                  other words, the uniform framework of proof planning
                  allows to solve a large class of problems that are
                  not automatically solvable by separate systems. Our
                  approach also gives an answer to the correctness
                  problems inherent in such an integration. We
                  advocate an approach where the computer algebra
                  system produces high-level protocol information that
                  can be processed by an interface to derive proof
                  plans. Such a proof plan in turn can be expanded to
                  proofs at different levels of abstraction, so the
                  approach is well-suited for producing a high-level
                  verbalised explication as well as for a low-level
                  machine checkable calculus-level proof. We present
                  an implementation of our ideas and exemplify them
                  using an automatically solved example."

  ABSTRACT =	 "A lot of the human ability to prove hard
                  mathematical theorems can be ascribed to a
                  domain-specific problem solving know-how. Such
                  knowledge is intrinsically incomplete. In order to
                  solve related problems, human mathematicians can go
                  beyond their acquired knowledge by adapting their
                  know-how. These two aspects, having rich experience
                  and extending it by need, can be simulated in a
                  proof planning framework. The domain-specific
                  reasoning knowledge is represented in form of
                  declarative planning operators, called
                  methods. Since these are declarative, they can be
                  mechanically adapted to new situations by so-called
                  meta-methods. In this contribution we apply this
                  framework to two prominent proofs in theorem
                  proving. First, we present methods for proving the
                  ground completeness of binary resolution, which
                  essentially correspond to key lemmata, and then, we
                  show how these methods can be reused for the proof
                  of the ground completeness of lock resolution."

ABSTRACT      = {
Logic programs can be synthesized as a by-product of the
planning of their verification proofs. This is achieved
by using higher-order variables at the proof planning level,
which become instantiated in the course of planning. We
illustrate two uses of such variables in proof planning
for program synthesis, one for synthesis proper and one
for the selection of induction schemes. We demonstrate that
the use of these variables can be restricted naturally in
such a way that terms containing them form a tractable extension
of first-order terms.},

                  action at the right moment are at the heart of
                  intelligent problem solving by humans. This includes
                  the analysis of failure events and the development
                  of ``recommendations'' to overcome typical
                  failures. In this article, we present how
                  meta-reasoning on failures is used in
                  multiple-strategy proof planning with the MULTI
                  system. MULTI allows for a flexible traversal of the
                  search space and a flexible construction of the
                  proof plan guided by mathematically motivated
                  heuristics. Because of the flexible control in MULTI
                  failures can be exploited to guide subsequent proof
                  plan manipulations and refinements. The failure
                  reasoning cannot only ease the derivation of a
                  solution proof plan but is required for some
                  problems to find a solution at all.",

                  includes appropriate induction principles. We
                  describe a system that automates program synthesis
                  via theorem proving in this way, building on control
                  strategies developed for verification proofs using
                  proof plans. This involves some extensions to the
                  control mechanism. The resultant system models an
                  approach to programming where program development
                  and proof proceed hand in hand, as advocated by
                  Gries."
