\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conc}

The examples presented in this paper trace the development of the
blending approach.  The early examples illustrate the reconstruction
of certain mathematical objects.  The middle examples begin to ``kick
back'' -- the blend provides an unexpected axiom, which turns out to
be mathematically provocative.  We noticed also that ``partial
combinations'' are a better reflection of mathematical practice than
``total combinations.''  Finally, the future-oriented challenge
question poses several problems for implementation, but also suggests
that as it develops, the blending approach can fruitfully combine
computer mathematics with learning science.  As regards computational
creativity, the current paper begins with reconstructions, but also
quickly shows how computed blends can suggest new mathematical
definitions and concepts of interest to practising mathematicians.
The analysis offered here shows how this work is a building block that
will be useful for future developments that are able to reason more
flexibly about mathematical problems -- and systematically find and
propose new concepts and problems.
