\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conc}

The examples presented in this paper trace the development of the
blending approach.
The current paper begins with reconstructions, but also
quickly shows how computed blends can suggest new mathematical
definitions and concepts of interest to practising mathematicians.
The analysis offered here shows that this work is a building block that
will be useful for future developments that are able to reason more
flexibly about mathematical problems -- and systematically find and
propose new concepts and problems.
