\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

We are concerned with creativity in mathematics: creativity
as evinced by human and artificial mathematicians,
individually and collectively.

The claim that \emph{conceptual blending} is central to creativity
has been advanced by among others Mark Turner, most recently
in \textcite{MTurner14}.

We see the latter view from George Steiner, who writes in 
\citet[p~145]{Ste01}:
\begin{quote}
  It is in mathematics and the sciences that the concepts of
creation and of invention, of intuition and of discovery,
exhibit the most immediate, visible force.
\end{quote}
